testing lab2_add:
ran it with threads 1, 10, 50 or 100
and iterations 100, 1000, 10000 or 100000

notes:
started getting race conditions starting with 10t1000i
consistent race conditions 10t10000ic

2.1.1
a) starting from 1000 iterations, with about 10 threads, does race conditions appear
with more iterations it only gets more consistent: with 10000 iterations, race conditions
are almost guaranteed to happen
b) with smaller iterations, threads can run and finish without the other threads even being initiated. 
thus race conditions can't happen. with larger iterations, the threads run for longer, 
increasing probability that a thread steps over another thread

2.1.2
a) yields are much slower because the threads give up the CPU for all the other threads
b) the additional time is due to all the context switching that's going on 
c) no, because most of the time is being lost to the others
