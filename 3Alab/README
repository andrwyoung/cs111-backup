Assumptions:
Equal amount of blocks in each group
No indirect blocks for directories

Problems:
Bitmap offsets are jank




Notes for discussion:
Block is fixed number of bytes
Can assume block size is 1024
	Assume also that fragmentation size is also 1024
	So writing 10 bytes takes up one block
Can assume only 1 block group
	superblock: all metadata about the filesystem
		starts at 1024. one block
		block size is in superblock
	group descriptor table: metadata about particular group
		starts at 2048. N blocks
		one group descriptor table per group
	block bitmap: which blocks are allocated. which are free
		one block
	inode bitmap: same but for inodes
		one block
		inode contains all the information for file
	inode table: holds all the inodes (in array)
	data blocks: all the data blocks 

logical block offsets:
1 - 12 are direct
13 - 268 are indirect
there 65536 double indirect blocks
there are 16777216 triple indirect blocks
